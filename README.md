# About the app
This repository contains an opensource implementation of a decentralized infection tracking on Android licensed under GPLv3. The implementation is similar the the one proposed by Google and Apple for contact tracing with the main difference that reporting the illness is not restricted to healthcare organizations but anybody using the app can do it based on self assessment.

# Purpose of the app

This app is intended to slow down the COVID-19 infection rate by notifying the connections of the infected person anonymously about the possibility of being infected, so the notified person can make precautions like making a COVID-19 test or voluntary social distancing.

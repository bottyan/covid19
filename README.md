# About the app
This repository contains an opensource implementation of a decentralized infection tracking on Android licensed under GPLv3. The implementation is similar the the one proposed by Google and Apple for contact tracing with the main difference that reporting the illness is not restricted to healthcare organizations but anybody using the app can do it based on self assessment.

# Purpose of the app

This app is intended to slow down the COVID-19 infection rate by notifying the connections of the infected person anonymously about the possibility of being infected, so the notified person can make precautions like making a COVID-19 test or voluntary social distancing.

## Why not on Google Play?

Currently (2020 April) Google uses the following store listing guidelines:
At Google Play we take our responsibility to provide accurate and relevant information for our users very seriously. For that reason, we are currently only approving apps that reference COVID-19 or related terms in their store listing if the app is published, commissioned, or authorized by an official government entity or public health organization, and the app does not contain any monetization mechanisms such as ads, in-app products, or in-app donations. This includes references in places such as the app title, description, release notes, or screenshots.

As this project is a completely independent initiative, it can not be listed.
